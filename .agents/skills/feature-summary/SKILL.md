# Feature Summary Skill

**Answers the question: How do we DOCUMENT and COMMUNICATE a feature to stakeholders, users, and developers?**

This skill focuses on **feature documentation and communication**, transforming detailed breakdowns into accessible, comprehensive summaries that serve multiple audiences.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you have a **completed feature** (or a detailed feature breakdown) and need to:
- Create comprehensive user-facing documentation
- Build a feature catalog or knowledge base
- Document business features for stakeholder communication
- Explain technical implementation to developers
- Create feature roadmaps and status tracking
- Document current and future capabilities
- Classify features by type (core, customization, performance, accessibility, UX)

**Key indicator**: You're asking "How do we document and communicate this feature?" or "What should users know about this capability?"

**Works best with**: This skill complements `feature-breakdown` (provides the detailed task list) and `feature-planning` (provides the execution sequence)

## When NOT to Use

- You only have a feature idea/spec without breakdown details → Use `feature-breakdown` first
- You need to determine task execution order → Use `feature-planning` instead
- You need to track real-time implementation progress → Use `execution-tracking` instead

## Prerequisites

Recommended (but not strictly required):

1. **Feature breakdown** (`docs/features/[feature-name]/breakdown.md`)
   - Provides detailed task list and component architecture
   - Helps identify all feature aspects to document
   
2. **Feature implementation** (completed or well-understood)
   - Access to working code or specifications
   - Understanding of current status

3. **Audience understanding**
   - Who will read this documentation?
   - What do they need to know?

## Inputs

- **Feature specification or implemented feature** (required)
- **Feature breakdown document** (recommended): `docs/features/[feature-name]/breakdown.md`
- **Source code access** (optional but helpful): For accurate implementation details
- **Usage examples** (optional): For user documentation

## Directory Structure

All feature-summary output must follow this structure:

```
docs/features/[feature-name]/
├── breakdown.md              (created by feature-breakdown skill)
├── summary.md                (created by this skill - PRIMARY OUTPUT)
├── configuration.md          (optional - created by this skill)
├── reference.md              (optional - created by this skill)
└── implementation-progress.md (created by execution-tracking skill during implementation)
```

## Outputs

**MANDATORY FILE ORGANIZATION**: All feature documentation must be in `docs/features/<feature-name>/` subdirectory.

When this skill completes, it creates:

1. **Primary Output: Feature Summary** (`docs/features/[feature-name]/summary.md`)
   - Comprehensive feature documentation
   - 150-250 lines covering all major aspects
   - Serves multiple audiences (users, developers, stakeholders)
   - Includes feature type classification
   - **Example**: `docs/features/git-blame-overlay/summary.md`

2. **Optional: Configuration Reference** (`docs/features/[feature-name]/configuration.md`)
   - Detailed configuration options and examples
   - For features with significant customization
   
3. **Optional: Reference Guide** (`docs/features/[feature-name]/reference.md`)
   - Technical implementation details for developers
   - Architecture decisions and patterns
   
4. **Supporting Structure**:
   - `docs/features/[feature-name]/breakdown.md` - Implementation tasks (created by feature-breakdown skill)
   - `docs/features/[feature-name]/implementation-progress.md` - Tracking file (created by execution-tracking skill)

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Analyze Feature Scope

**Input**: Feature specification, breakdown, or implementation

1. **Identify feature aspects**:
   - What does it do? (Core functionality)
   - Why is it valuable? (Business value)
   - How do users interact with it? (User experience)
   - What are the key capabilities? (Feature list)
   - What are the limitations? (Edge cases and constraints)

2. **Extract technical details**:
   - How is it implemented? (Architecture, components)
   - What are the technical requirements? (Dependencies, prerequisites)
   - Where is the code located? (Source file references)
   - What patterns or technologies are used?

3. **Understand current state**:
   - Version number and release status
   - When was it introduced?
   - What improvements or fixes have been made?
   - Is it production-ready?

### Phase 2: Classify Feature Type

Assign the feature to one or more categories:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Core Functionality** | Essential feature defining the product's primary purpose | Git blame overlay, authentication system |
| **Customization** | Allows users to personalize behavior and appearance | Output patterns, color customization |
| **User Experience** | Improves usability, visual integration, and workflow | Theme adaptation, command palette |
| **Accessibility** | Supports users with different abilities and needs | Color options, keyboard shortcuts, ARIA labels |
| **Performance** | Optimizes speed and resource usage | Caching, lazy loading, pagination |
| **Extended Functionality** | Non-essential features that enhance core capability | Advanced filtering, export options |
| **Developer Experience** | Improves developer productivity and experience | Debugging tools, API documentation |

## Output Format

Feature summaries include these key sections (in order):

1. **Feature Header** - Name, overview, status, version, feature type
2. **Business Value** - Why it matters, specific benefits
3. **What It Does** - Core functionality with user experience and examples
4. **Key Features** - Capabilities and extended functionality
5. **Configuration** (if applicable) - Options and examples
6. **Technical Implementation** - Code references and architecture
7. **User Interactions** - Workflows and commands
8. **Status and Roadmap** - Current status, limitations, future enhancements
9. **Related Features** - Cross-references to related features

- [`examples/example-feature-summary-performance.md`](examples/example-feature-summary-performance.md) - Performance example

## Feature Type Classification

Every feature should be classified with a primary type and optional secondary types. This helps users understand:
- **What is this feature?** (Its purpose)
- **Is it essential?** (Core vs. optional)
- **How does it relate to other features?** (Ecosystem awareness)

### Quick Reference

| Type | Icon | Purpose | Example |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| **Core Functionality** | ⭐ | Essential, defines product purpose | Git blame overlay |
| **Customization** | 🎨 | Personalization & preferences | Output patterns |
| **User Experience** | 👥 | Usability & visual integration | Theme-aware styling |
| **Accessibility** | ♿ | Support for diverse users | Color options |
| **Performance** | 🚀 | Speed & resource optimization | Caching system |
| **Extended Functionality** | ➕ | Optional enhancements | Export options |
| **Developer Experience** | 🛠️ | Developer productivity | API docs |

**For detailed guidance on each type**, see [`references/feature-type-reference.md`](references/feature-type-reference.md)

## Guidelines

### Writing for Multiple Audiences

**For Users**:
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Explain benefits and use cases
- Provide concrete examples
- Include configuration examples

**For Developers**:
- Include code references and file paths
- Explain architecture and design decisions
- Document patterns and conventions
- Link to technical documentation

**For Stakeholders**:
- Lead with business value
- Emphasize impact and ROI
- Focus on status and roadmap
- Quantify benefits where possible

### Feature Classification

When assigning feature types:

1. **Identify primary category**: What is this feature's main purpose?
2. **Note secondary categories**: Can it serve multiple purposes?
3. **Explain classification**: Why does this categorization make sense?
4. **Consider user perception**: How do users think about this feature?

### Technical Accuracy

- Reference actual source code paths
- Include line numbers for specific implementations
- Verify all code examples work correctly
- Document technical constraints accurately

### Keeping Documentation Current

- Update status section when feature versions change
- Add to limitations if new constraints are discovered
- Move items from "Future Enhancements" when implemented
- Update configuration examples if options change

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too technical for users**: Remember non-technical readers; explain technical concepts
❌ **Too vague for developers**: Provide specific code references and implementation details
❌ **Incomplete feature classification**: Always explain why a feature fits its category
❌ **Missing examples**: Concrete examples are crucial for understanding
❌ **Outdated information**: Keep status and version info current
❌ **Poor cross-linking**: Reference related features; help readers understand relationships
❌ **Missing technical details**: Developers need code references and architecture info
