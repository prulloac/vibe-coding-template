# Integration Guide (Redirected)

This content has been split into two more focused documents for better readability:

## New Structure

### 1. **ecosystem-diagram.md** - Big Picture
- Visual overview of all four skills
- Directory structure and organization
- Decision matrix: when to use each skill
- Information flow diagram
- Execution order recommendations

**→ Start here** if you're new to feature documentation

### 2. **workflow-integration-guide.md** - Practical Details
- Step-by-step workflows with real examples
- How to extract information from breakdown.md
- How to integrate with feature-planning
- Weekly maintenance procedures
- Common pitfalls and solutions

**→ Go here** when you're actually using the skills
